	<h2>Domain Verification</h2>
	<p>Domain verification is a system that Henlo has in place to help verify the identity of our users.</p>
	<h3>First you must run this command:</h3>
	<p><b>/ad</b> <i>DOMAIN (a domain you own)</i></p>
	<p>After doing this create a new file in the root of your domain called henlo-verified.txt and put your username in it (Example: https://henlo.xyz/henlo-verified.txt). Don't delete this file or your domain will be hidden from your profile.</p>
